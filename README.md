Basic-Util
==========

Various small bits of code that I've found to be useful here and there,
and have ended-up copy-pasting once too many to reusue in different 
projects.

The one and only rule all these bits have to follow is they shall 
not require extra dependencies beyond what is found in the 
Java standard library.
