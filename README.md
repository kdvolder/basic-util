Basic-Util
==========

Various small bits of code that I've found to be useful here and there.
They've ended-up being copy-pasted once too many time. Putting them
into a separate 'util' project to avoid more copy-pasting.

There isn't a common theme to any of these. The one and only rule all 
these bits have to follow is they shall not require extra dependencies 
beyond what is found in the Java standard library.
